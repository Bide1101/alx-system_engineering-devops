Processes and Signals
Introduction
Processes and signals are fundamental concepts in the context of computer systems and operating systems. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of these concepts and how they work together to enable efficient task management and communication within a computing environment.

Processes
A process can be thought of as an independent, running instance of a program within the operating system. Each process has its own dedicated memory space, including variables, resources, and instructions. This isolation allows processes to execute concurrently and independently, enhancing the overall efficiency of the system.

Key aspects of processes include:

PID (Process ID): A unique identifier assigned by the operating system to each process. PIDs are crucial for managing and controlling processes.

Parent and Child Processes: Processes can create new processes, leading to a parent-child relationship. The parent process can monitor and manage its child processes.

Process States: Processes can be in various states, such as running, sleeping, stopped, or terminated. Understanding these states is essential for effective process management.

Signals
Signals are software interrupts that facilitate communication between processes or between the operating system and processes. They serve as lightweight and asynchronous mechanisms for notifying processes about specific events.

Common signals include:

SIGINT (2): Sent to a process when the user interrupts the process, typically by pressing Ctrl+C. This signal is used to request a graceful termination of the process.

SIGTERM (15): This signal is a termination request sent to a process, asking it to terminate gracefully.

SIGKILL (9): An immediate termination signal that forcefully terminates a process without allowing it to clean up or save its state.

SIGUSR1 (10) and SIGUSR2 (12): User-defined signals that can be used for custom communication purposes between processes.

Managing Processes and Signals
Effectively managing processes and signals is vital for maintaining a stable and responsive operating system. Commonly used utilities for process management include ps for listing processes, kill for sending signals to processes, and top for monitoring process activity.

Signal handling in programs can be achieved through signal handlers. These handlers are functions responsible for processing signals received by the process. In Unix-based systems, signal handlers can be registered using system calls like sigaction().

Examples
This repository provides various examples demonstrating how to manage processes and handle signals in different programming languages, including C, Python, and Bash scripts.

C: Contains examples of creating child processes and handling signals in C programs.

Python: Demonstrates how to use the signal module to handle signals in Python scripts.

Bash Scripts: Provides examples of signal handling in Bash scripts.
